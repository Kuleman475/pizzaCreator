# Pizza Creator

# Overview

This app is a way to have an order of Pizza made with different sizes, sauces, and toppings. it also saves your previous orders so if you have a pizza you tried and really liked it will be in the saved pizzas page. you will select size and sauce using the radio buttons and using buttons for each of the toppings when you select it it will change colors so you can know what the toppings you chose are. 

I created this app because I thought it would be fun to be able to create something that can be very customizable like pizza and seeing how different people prefer the different tastes.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used VS code to create the program and have an app on my phone to see the app on my phone and Android studio on my laptop to test it on other screen sizes and phones.

I used React native code as my language of choice. I haven't used react, I have used Javascript which is similar to react so it wasn't too steep of a learning curve.

# Future Work

* Add a button to be able to make random Pizza's
* Select a single Pizza from the saved to make as a "Favorite"
* Change the colors up or have a picture of a pizza as the background of the home page
